              We were inspired by clean, colorful websites that utilized
              illustrated cards to express their software elements. We took
              functionalities from clean sample web apps and converted them into
              new clean cards and elements. Since NEITI had minimal brand
              guidelines, we had room to refresh that as well. We used linear
              gradients that ranged from red to dark purple and made use of
              shadow for a clean look and effect. We applied this across their
              entire website.

              After UI & Website Discovery, the team moved on to high-fidelity.
              We used existing brand guidelines for the cards, typography,
              colors, and buttons, however, we designed new look and feel for a
              modern effect. Here are the final designs.
